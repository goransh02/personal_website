I was definitely\n                  intimidated by the people that I'll meet at insti, I felt that\n                  I would always feel out of place! I thought that I would be\n                  friends with none and would die alone! However, as being\n                  excited is my ground state, I was equally super excited to\n                  start my new journey!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Remembering my <span className=\"purple\">first</span> \"rainy\"\n                  day at insti in the middle of all the very \"important\"\n                  orientations, I was trying to have my first conversations with\n                  people and make new friends! Thanks to my extrovert nature I\n                  made a lot of friends in my first semester! That time was just\n                  magically, I haven't felt that innocent in while now:)! It\n                  actually felt like we were getting rewarded for the\n                  preparations for two or more years!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Even though my fear of not making any friends and being a\n                  loner died out too quickly, I was still very intimidated by\n                  such talented people all around me, some with exceptional\n                  literature knowledge, some with amazing guitar skills, some\n                  with amazing humor (okay, I didn't meet any such person else\n                  we would be dating currently!) or obviously some with\n                  extremely great IQ!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  One thing that I would say is non-negotiable in the first year\n                  is to have a good CPI.{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\n                    Aim for a stellar one -- you know as they say even if you\n                    fall, you still land on the moon!\n                  </span>{\" \"}\n                  The mistake I think I did in the first semester was of\n                  doubting myself \"too much\". I wasn't sure how well I could\n                  perform which made me set lower expectations for myself and\n                  hence achieving less than what I do now.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  To top that up, in my first semester, I was in a group of all\n                  toppers, everyone being perfect 10 holders! I mean I wasn't a\n                  poor performer but I wasn't even a perfect 10 scorer. I used\n                  to do decently well but when I used to score less compared to\n                  my friends, I used to feel low to everyone else in the insti!\n                  My friends were supportive no doubt, but the power of\n                  self-doubt undoes every other thing, right? I was too harsh\n                  with myself and hence had little confidence that I could do\n                  well.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  However, this self-doubt didn't stop me from trying out\n                  different initiatives and PORs in insti. I was the{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Class Representative</span> of my\n                  batch which helped me connect with a lot of batchmates and\n                  seniors in CS. I also was very interested in entrepreneurship\n                  and took part in different competitions by E-Cell, including\n                  the <span className=\"purple\">E-Buzz competition</span> in\n                  which our team secured the first position among all freshmen.\n                  (Well, it was a pretty confidence boost xD). I took part in{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Manch 3.0</span> which turned out to\n                  be a year-long affair and I still have some Amazon coupons to\n                  spend which I ended up winning for being overall third. I also\n                  did try to participate in some dance events, but my super shy\n                  ass didn't get me through the end.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  All things combined, I'd say I had an amazing first semester\n                  and I guess I was most carefree then (only to bear\n                  consequences later xD). I still miss the late-night chats\n                  sitting in the canteen shed when it was raining high, and all\n                  of me and my friends were sharing their school stories and\n                  just letting out all the fear and anxiety we have faced. We\n                  went out to a couple of places in Mumbai, including the\n                  mandatory <span className=\"purple\">Marine Drive</span> after\n                  Midsems. I went on my first trek to{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Visapur</span> which could have been\n                  my last, had I not being helped by 10 people including my\n                  friends and the trainer.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Although your little Dora's exploration of the city began\n                  after we were done with Endsems and waiting for the papers to\n                  get checked and cribs being handled. None of the 12 in my\n                  group went back home and we were there all day with the only\n                  task of going to new places, trying out new food, and enjoy!\n                  We went to <span className=\"purple\">Imagica</span>! Just to\n                  digress a bit, I want to highlight that if you're still a kid\n                  like me, don't go on the scary rides, even if your friends\n                  tell you that it'll be absolutely okay, else you'll just end\n                  up lying fainted in your friends' arms. Overall, Imagica was a\n                  fun experience for me but I may not go there again unless\n                  you're buying my tickets. We also went to{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Barbeque Nation</span>, where I'm\n                  again not going unless I turn non-vegetarian. We watched two\n                  movies as well, one was{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Chichore</span> in which I didn't\n                  feel very goose-bumpy then but now at my home, I'll use up all\n                  the tissue papers crying out!

It was super easy for me to figure out\n                  that I could do much better academically if only I wasn't\n                  scared and didn't compare myself with my friends so I decided\n                  to be a little more serious from next semester and spend less\n                  time with my friends and focus more on me and my academics.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  My first winter break wasn't well planned and I just wasted\n                  the initial time chatting with my insti friends. However, I\n                  had to participate in the{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Inter IIT Tech 8.0</span> which had\n                  to happen at IIT Roorkee. So I flew back to Bombay from where\n                  I had to go to Roorkee again. Yes, quite surprising for me too\n                  to make it to the team in the first year but it was a hell of\n                  an experience!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  I initially thought of not including this topic in this blog\n                  but then it has been important to me, so I guess it would be\n                  an injustice if I skip it. But as a responsible writer, let me\n                  warn you of the cringe that I'll be throwing at you for the\n                  couple next of paragraphs.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  So! I met a guy in the beautiful chilly winters of Roorkee,\n                  (well I met him in insti only, but it sounds more romantic\n                  that way). Never in my 20 years of life have I met such an\n                  attractive person. I was so deeply in awe of his personality\n                  and attractiveness (not to forget, cuteness) that I barely\n                  could land my eyes on anyone else.  The days at Roorkee flew\n                  by so quickly and I ended up winning Bronze in my competition.\n                  However, for a long time, I made the joke, that for real I won\n                  a diamond:) \n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  I was so shit scared that we wouldn't be in contact when we\n                  reach insti (yk, things that happen in Roorkee, stay in\n                  Roorkee!) that I didn't leave him till we were at the terminal\n                  gate of my flight and there was no way he was catching the\n                  same flight and I had to say goodbye to that sweetheart!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Oh and I also made a lot of friends at Roorkee, and I love all\n                  you guys xD!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Back in Mumbai, I attended the{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Mood Indigo,</span> you know Asia's\n                  largest college cultural festival.

I decreased the amount of time I spent with my friends in\n                  the first semester and naturally made some new friends. I\n                  started planning my weeks ahead which had helped me keep track\n                  of my academic work and other small commitments. I was\n                  \"trying\" to eat healthy by buying fruits and stuff, which I\n                  really liked! And I drastically decreased comparing and\n                  criticizing myself now and then. I was able to take up\n                  extracurricular responsibilities I was interested in and spent\n                  some decent time with my first. My scale was balanced out! For\n                  quite a long time, I had an eye for one thing, no not the guy!\n                  but Mars Rover Technical Team (MRT), I really wanted to be in\n                  MRT since the orientation day when I first got to know about\n                  it! MRT applications including some other convenor\n                  applications started as well soon enough and it took a bit of\n                  time to fill the forms and write SOPs.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  As my irrational fear of not making a single friend broke out\n                  pretty quick, the fear that \"we\" won't be in contact when we\n                  reach insti broke out as well. We did meet in insti, it was a\n                  ritual I guess, meeting every Thursday. His presence \"somehow\"\n                  made all my problems easier. As cheesy as it may sound, he was\n                  like my comfy home in insti. No doubt my family liked him! I\n                  went on the best Valentine's Date I could think of. We went\n                  out couple more times and also some cute night outs, and then\n                  this corona happened and we had to be back home!

I\n                  did a lot of online courses and did a lot of mini-projects\n                  that helped me improve my coding skills.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />I was the part of{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Tapestry Web Development</span> team\n                  and worked on the frontend.

And I was a\n                  pretty critic of myself, as in a normal setup I usually would\n                  so much more than just academics but this sem, I wasn't able\n                  to anything other than academics (and cry xD). Weeks by weeks,\n                  I was trying to put up different projects or responsibilities\n                  on my schedule which weren't just getting done, which gave me\n                  chance to look down upon myself again. I was seeing FB posts\n                  of some machaxx people in insti which made me criticize myself\n                  even more, for not saving the world, dying from corona! My\n                  journal from then would read something like, \"why am I\n                  thinking about this stupid problem, why don't I feel like\n                  saving the world, why can't I be like Obama, why is this thing\n                  bothering me\".\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Oh boy, I was a hard mother for myself! I was trying to push\n                  myself too much to get out of the cycle and be on my old\n                  routine of working my ass off! This did result in some good as\n                  my pushy nature ensured that I was properly apping to\n                  different unvis and profs. I also contacted some seniors for\n                  some apping advice, one of which is my closest friend\n                  presently! Apping somewhat helped me get my current internship\n                  at <span className=\"purple\">Indiana University</span> as well.\n                  I was also actively able to contribute to the Roommate\n                  Matching project, unlike some other projects.{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\n                    Lately, I've been thinking that that maybe it is good to\n                    push ourselves and raise our limits but only to a point that\n                    we don't break ourselves.\n                  </span>\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  I also would mention that I was in contact with an SWC mentor\n                  which I don't want to skip as she really helped me let out my\n                  thoughts weekly and I guess its good to consider if you're\n                  having an emotional period especially with this lockdown,\n                  second wave, and emerging third wave!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Winter breaks are usually small in insti but this year was\n                  smaller coz all of our year's holidays were sucked into corona\n                  holidays earlier only. We had about a month-long with us. The\n                  best thing that happened this winter was{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">FeMeal</span>, my startup. Originally\n                  we started with preparing for the{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Hult Prize competition</span> which\n                  we won and then we started pursuing this full time. This truly\n                  was when I felt good and confident about myself after 4\n                  months. I did a short 1.5 months long intern at\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Idfy, Mumbai</span>. This is such a\n                  nice company with such great corporative vibes lol! I got paid\n                  well so that ticked all the boxes. I wasn't super productive\n                  again but as time heals everything, I was better. I wanted to\n                  take things slow because the counterproductive game that goes\n                  in my head became quite clear to me!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />I wanted to start reading again which I did -- oh man\n                  when the little sun rises in the cold winters and you can for\n                  once laze out outside, feeling like an old woman, and read\n                  your book -- it feels so gratifying:) I read{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">And then they were none\"</span> --\n                  which was a nice 'one-time' read book and the{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\"Startup Sutra\"</span>\n                  which was again a nice 'one-time' read. I started working\n                  diligently towards Women Who Code and took lead in organizing\n                  various events. I didn't get on a regular bath schedule again\n                  which is fair, given the icy cold winters North have!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  For <span className=\"purple\">semester 4</span>, I honestly\n                  didn't plan a lot as my planning failed majorly last semester.\n                  I however did plan one thing which was taking{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">54 credits</span>. Well yes, I saw\n                  this as the only way to do justice to my CPI drop last\n                  semester. For the courses, I didn't even choose the easier\n                  ones, coz you know if I have to do it, I'll do it tough. I\n                  knew that as my academic load would be high and I'd have to\n                  work on my startup, FeMeal along with preparing for Hult Prize\n                  Regionals (to be held in February), I would have less time to\n                  weep!\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  January was the most packed month for me, I had my intern from\n                  winters going on as well. I had to work for FeMeal and had\n                  planned two events for WWC that I was leading, all of this\n                  along with my academics to manage, I was super serious about\n                  academics this semester as I had to increase my CPI. My elder\n                  cousin brother came home around then and oh god which is when\n                  I realized how much I missed human contact! By February, I\n                  guess my soul returned to my body and I was back chirpy, on\n                  track with the academics and other commitments I had to\n                  manage. I was sad sometimes but then maybe because I resonated\n                  too much with the meme --{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\n                    \"Mera Janam toh Gayal hone ke liye hi hua hai\"\n                  </span>\n                  , I was back normal pretty quickly. I reconnected with my old\n                  school friends and it was super fun! This was the semester I\n                  started working for MRT devotedly as well, did some coding,\n                  and helped onboard freshies in the team smoothly.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  After midterms, I was more focused on academics (I guess that\n                  happens with everyone lol!) and I gave less time to some less\n                  prioritized commitments. I was \"officially\" selected for my\n                  Indiana intern by that time and even those meetings began to\n                  happen. I applied for Department Research Coordinator and got\n                  selected for the year 21-22.{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">Inter IIT Tech</span> came again this\n                  year in about March and we won Silver (in a high prep\n                  challenge) and were second overall! This year the tech meet\n                  was much more huge and we had an amazing team, which I\n                  absolutely enjoyed working with!{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\n                    Oh and thankfully, I didn't fall in love this year:)\n                  </span>\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  The most amazing and important thing that I did this semester\n                  was <span className=\"purple\">losing weight</span>. I didn't\n                  have much, but I gained a couple kgs in this lockdown and I\n                  had thyroid. After some fruitless efforts of some weeks of\n                  leaving sugar, I contacted one of my very close friends (yes,\n                  the same apping tips guy) who himself had lost massive weight\n                  who guided me on my \"weight loss journey\" -- it ain't too much\n                  but honest work. Finally, the semester ended which I feel like\n                  the longest till now xD with overall nice grades and yes my\n                  CPI is back to normal again:) Oh, in case I didn't mention, I\n                  came in touch with my insti friends again:)\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  So yes, this was a brief peek in my 2 years journey at IIT\n                  Bombay, full of ups and downs. I would say that I hustle too\n                  much and hence sometimes end up getting in trouble which I'm\n                  completely okay with as long as I work hard and \"hustle\". I\n                  like to try different projects and things that interest me to\n                  do more.\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                  Finally, as legends do, some advice that I would give my\n                  freshie-self is --{\" \"}\n                  <span className=\"purple\">\n                    don't doubt yourself, you're just as good as others and\n                    you're a strong hardworking person who knows how to work for\n                    things that actually matter -- so you will sail through, oh\n                    and yes, don't fill in the form for Inter IIT Tech, just\n                    don't xD!\n                  </span>\n                  <br />\n                  <br />\n                </p>\n                {/* </blockquote> */}\n              </Card.Body>\n            </Card>\n          </Col>\n          <Col md={5} className=\"about-img\">\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n                paddingTop: \"130px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img\n                src={IITB0}\n                alt=\"about\"\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\n                style={{\n                  width: \"300px\",\n                }}\n              />\n              First pic in the gallery of an average IITBian!\n            </Row>\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n\n                paddingTop: \"300px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img src={IITB1} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" />\n              Pizza party @ H15 Hostel -- I sneaked in all my friends!\n            </Row>\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n\n                paddingTop: \"100px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img\n                src={IITB2}\n                alt=\"about\"\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\n                style={{\n                  width: \"400px\",\n                }}\n              />\n              We at Ubisoft, Mumbai -- after being among the top 5 teams in the\n              Game Jam 2k19 Challenge, IIT Bombay!\n            </Row>\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n\n                paddingTop: \"100px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img\n                src={IITB3}\n                alt=\"about\"\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\n                style={{\n                  width: \"400px\",\n                }}\n              />\n              Us at Imagica -- guess which of these is me?\n            </Row>\n\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n\n                paddingTop: \"290px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img src={IITB4} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" />\n              Inter IIT Tech Meet 8.0 @ IIT Roorkee\n            </Row>\n            <Row></Row>\n            <Row></Row>\n            <Row></Row>\n\n            <Row\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n                paddingTop: \"430px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img src={TathuImg} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" />\n              Us:) -- I'm not bending, it's just the height difference xD\n              (excuse the poor jk!)\n            </Row>\n            <Row\n              // md={5}\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n                paddingTop: \"1750px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img src={IITB13} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" />\n              FeMeal Team (present)\n            </Row>\n\n            {/* <Row\n              // md={5}\n              style={{\n                justifyContent: \"center\",\n                paddingTop: \"400px\",\n              }}\n              className=\"about-img\"\n            >\n              <img\n                src={IITB9}\n                alt=\"about\"\n                className=\"img-fluid\"\n                style={{\n                  width: \"300px\",\n                }}\n              />\n              Me and my two cutie brothers!

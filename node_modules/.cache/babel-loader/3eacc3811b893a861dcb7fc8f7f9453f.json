her own mark with whatever\n                    comes her way! <br /> <br />\n                    This fearless bold girl however wasn't really confident this\n                    time. She did receive her fair share of applauses for\n                    clearing \"the JEE\" but parallelly she was cautioned about\n                    the brightest kids of the country, she'll be meeting at IIT\n                    Bombay CSE! I was intimidated by the people I'll meet at\n                    insti, and felt that I would not fit and always feel out of\n                    the place! I thought that I would be friends with none and\n                    would die alone! However, as being excited is my ground\n                    state, I was super excited to start my new journey! <br /> <br />\n                    Remembering my first \"rainy\" day at insti in middle of all\n                    the very \"important\" orientations, I was trying to have\n                    first conversations with people and make new friends! Thanks\n                    to my extrovert nature I made a lot of friends in my first\n                    semester! That time was just magically, I haven't felt that\n                    innocent in while now:)! It actually felt like we were\n                    getting rewarded for the preparations for two or more years!{\" \"}\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    Even though my fear of not making any friends and being a\n                    loner died out too quickly, I was still very intimidated by\n                    such talented people all around me, some with exceptional\n                    literature knowledge, the guitar guys (no stereotyping\n                    sorry), some with amazing humor (okay, I didn't meet any\n                    such person else we would be dating currently!) or obviously\n                    some with extremely great IQ! <br /> <br />\n                    One thing that I would say is non-negotiable in first year\n                    is to have a good CPI. Aim for a stellar one -- you know as\n                    they say even if you fail, you still land on moon! The\n                    mistake I think I did in the first semester was of doubting\n                    myself too much. I wasn't sure how well I could perform\n                    which lead to me setting lower expectations for myself and\n                    hence achieving less that what I do now. To top that up, in\n                    my first semester, I was in a group of all toppers, everyone\n                    being perfect 10 holders! I mean I wasn't a poor performer\n                    but I wasn't even a perfect 10 scorer. I used to do decently\n                    well but when I used to be score less compared to my\n                    friends, I used to feel low to everyone else in the insti!\n                    My friends were supportive no doubt, but the power of self\n                    doubt undoes every other thing. I was too harsh with myself\n                    and hence had little confidence that I could do well. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    However, this self doubt didn't stop me from trying out\n                    different initiatives in insti and PORs. I was the Class\n                    Representative of my batch which helped me connect with a\n                    lot batchmates and seniors in CS. I also was very interested\n                    in entrepreneurship and took part if different competitions\n                    by E-Cell, including the E-Buzz competition in which our\n                    team secured the first position in among all freshmen.\n                    (Well, that was a pretty confidence boast xD) I took part in\n                    Manch 3.0 which turned out to be an year long affair and I\n                    still have some Amazon coupons to spend which I ended up\n                    winning for being overall third. I also did try to\n                    participate in some dance events, but my super shy ass\n                    didn't me through the end. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    All things combined, I'd say I had an amazing first semester\n                    and I guess I was most carefree then (only to bear\n                    consequences later xD). I still miss the late night chats\n                    sitting in the canteen shed, when it was raining high, and\n                    all of me and my friends were sharing their school stories\n                    and just letting out all the fear and anxiety we have faced.\n                    We went out to a couple of places in Mumbai, including the\n                    mandatory Marine Drive after Midsems. I went on my first\n                    trek which could have been my last, had I not being helped\n                    by 10 people including my friends and the trainer. Well, at\n                    least I'm not going again till I don't get fit and have the\n                    right kind of shoes coz mine just sucked in all the dirt and\n                    water! \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    Although your little Dora's exploration of the city began\n                    after we were done with endsems and waiting for the papers\n                    to get checked and cribs being handled. None of us 12 in my\n                    group of friends went back home and we were there all day\n                    and the only task to do was to go to new places, try out new\n                    food and enjoy! We went to Imagica! Just to digress a bit, I\n                    want to highlight that if you're still a kid like me, don't\n                    go on the scary rides, even if your friends tell you that\n                    it'll be absolutely okay, else you'll just end up lying\n                    fainted in your friends arms. Overall, Imagica was a fun\n                    experience for me but I may not go there again unless you're\n                    buying my tickets. We also went to Barbeque Nation, where\n                    I'm again not going unless I turn non-vegetarian. We watched\n                    two movies as well, one was Chichore in which I didn't feel\n                    very goose-bumpy then but now at my home, I'll use up all\n                    the tissue papers crying out!  The other was Ford vs\n                    Ferrari, during which I slept in the middle, so don't ask me\n                    the story line. However, the thing that is close to my heart\n                    were the nightouts that we did on the roof tops of VMCC and\n                    other buildings in the insti. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    When I finally came back home after those 4+ super fast\n                    paced months at insti, I got the time to think and figure\n                    out what went wrong in the first semester and what I should\n                    improve from next semester! It was super easy for me to\n                    figure out that I could do much better academically only if\n                    I wasn't scared and didn't compare myself with my friends so\n                    I decided to be a little more serious from next semester and\n                    spend less time with my friends and focus more on me and my\n                    academics. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    My first winter break wasn't well planned and I just wasted\n                    the initial time chatting with my insti friends. However I\n                    had to participate in the Inter IIT Tech 8.0 which had to\n                    happen at IIT Roorkee. So I flew back to Bombay from where I\n                    had to go to Roorkee again. Yes, quite surprising for me too\n                    to make it to the team in first year but a hell of a\n                    experience it was! \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    I initially thought of not including this topic in this blog\n                    but then it has been important to me, so I guess it would be\n                    an injustice if I skip it. But as a responsible writer, let\n                    me warn you of the cringe that I'll be throwing at you for\n                    the couple next paragraphs. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    So! I met a guy in the beautiful chilly winters of Roorkee,\n                    (well I met him in insti only, but it sounds more romantic\n                    that way). Never in my 20 years of life have I met such an\n                    attractive person. I was so deeply in awe of his personality\n                    and attractiveness that I barely could land my eyes on\n                    anyone else.  The days at Roorkee flew by so quickly and I\n                    ended up winning Bronze in my competition. However, for a\n                    long time I made the joke, that for real I won a diamond:) {\" \"}\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    I was so shit scared that we wouldn't be in contact when we\n                    reach insti (yk, things that happen in Roorkee, stay in\n                    Roorkee!) that I didn't leave him till we were at the\n                    terminal gate of my flight and there was no way he was\n                    catching the same flight and I had to say goodbye to that\n                    sweetheart! \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    Back in Mumbai, I attended the Mood Indigo, you know the\n                    Asia's largest college culture festival. It was a nice\n                    experience, however you could get by the fact that I slept\n                    in Deepika's show -- I didn't care coz my heart had already\n                    got someone else's attraction who didn't happen to be in\n                    Mumbai, so I was updating him with what he was missing by\n                    not attending MI including Zakir, Deepika and ofcourse me!{\" \"}\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    Back when the second semester started, I was clear to set my\n                    priorities right, having academics on top. I decreased the\n                    amount of time I spent with my friends in first semester and\n                    naturally made some new friends. I started planning my weeks\n                    ahead which had helped me keep track of my academic work and\n                    other small commitments that I had taken up like in the\n                    first semester. I was \"trying\" to eat healthy by buying\n                    fruits in different weeks which I really liked! And I\n                    decreased comparing and criticizing myself now and then\n                    drastically.  I was able to take up extracurricular\n                    responsibilities that I was interested in and spent some\n                    decent time with my first. My scale was balanced out! From\n                    quite long, I had an eye for one thing, no not the guy! but\n                    Mars Rover Technical Team (MRT), I really wanted to be in\n                    MRT since the orientation day when I first got to know about\n                    it! There were some convenor applications that started soon\n                    enough and took a bit of time to fill the forms and write\n                    SOPs. \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    As my irrational fear of not making a single friend broke\n                    out pretty quick, the fear that \"we\" won't be in contact\n                    when we reach insti broke out as well. We did meet in insti,\n                    quite a times, it was a ritual I guess, meeting every\n                    Thursdays. His presence \"somehow\" made all my problems\n                    easier. As cheesy as it may sound, he was like my comfy home\n                    in insti. No doubt my family liked him! I went on the best\n                    Valentine's Date I could think of. We went out couple more\n                    times and also some cute nightouts, and then this corona\n                    happened and we had to be back home! And I was left to\n                    contemplate why didn't I kiss that idiot when I had the\n                    chance to! \n                    <br /> <br />\n                    Well that was 0.75 real part of my story at IIT Bombay and\n                    rest is the 1.25 imaginary part of the story at the \"online\n                    setup\" in these \"unprecedent times\". <br /> <br />\n\n                    Continuing, he proposed me almost just after we came home\n                    (and obviously I said yes) thinking it would be just 15 days\n                    break and then we would be back together in campus. Little\n                    did we (or anyone) knew it would extend to fucking 1.25\n                    years and still counting! <br /> <br />\n                    \n                    My first year summers were quite\n                    an amazing experience. Started off little slow with me\n                    figuring out what things to do. As a regular freshie, I took\n                    up SOS, SOC and ITSP (dropped later on) and started working\n                    with it. I was afraid with coding in my first year (Yes, my\n                    major is Computer Science!) but then I spend a huge amount\n                    of summer coding. I did a lot of online courses and did a\n                    lot of mini-projects that helped me improve my coding\n                    skills. I was also the part of Tapestry Web Development team\n                    and worked on the frontend. Trust me, I had no idea about\n                    React and Redux but in the small amount of time that we had,\n                    I learnt it all and completed the project. I also did the\n                    Krittika Summer Project by the astronomy club of our\n                    institute, Krittika, which was an awesome project and also\n                    gave me a sense of being connected with my astronomy love. I\n                    also was selected for a UX-UI Research based project under\n                    Ms. Melaine Lent who is a Product Consultant at Accenture to\n                    work on the Roommate Matching Application project (we are\n                    still working on that). I was so afraid of CP but in this\n                    summers I also started CP over Codechef mainly (okay, that\n                    was purely to impress my boyfriend, but I still did xD). I\n                    also started volunteering for Women Who Code, Mumbai. These\n                    summers were best for me as I discovered that I could do\n                    much more than the boundaries I've been setting across for\n                    myself. I figured out my secret was to hustle, take up new\n                    projects, online courses and managing/ leadership activities\n                    which interests me, as they came along. I spent a lot of my\n                    time in front of the laptop working on projects and stuff\n                    and the remaining rest of my free time chatting you know\n                    with whom. I didn't go out anywhere entire summers obviously\n                    because of the lockdown. <br /> <br />\n\n                    Semester 3, as they say is the most difficult of all for CS\n                    students and it's kind of a big \"giant leap\" that we as CS\n                    sophomores take when we step into the second year. So, I was\n                    all prepped up for this ruthless semester with all my\n                    planners done, my notebooks ready to be filled up with all\n                    the lecture notes (oh yes, I still do that!) and importantly\n                    my mind set for the hardships to come along also given the\n                    online setting! <br /> <br />\n\n                    One week into the semester and he broke up. Oh yes, it was\n                    that sudden. Initially my mind didn't just accept that\n                    something happened but then the hurt from the other side\n                    increased to a point where I couldn't bear anymore and I\n                    decided to cut off. It shattered me completely and I could\n                    feel the pain. During almost the entire semester 3, I was\n                    going through a very emotionally unstable time. I also cut\n                    off with almost all my friends except my best friend and\n                    didn't interact with others much, which was pretty harsh for\n                    myself given my extrovert and chirpy nature. <br /> <br />\n                    \n                    My schedule was more or less, attending lectures, completing\n                    assignments, crying and going back to sleep. And I was\n                    pretty critic of myself, as in a normal setup I usually\n                    would so much more than just academics but this sem, I\n                    wasn't able to anything other than academics (and cry xD).\n                    Weeks by weeks, I was trying to put up different projects or\n                    responsibilities on my schedule which weren't just getting\n                    done, which gave me chance to look down upon myself again. I\n                    was seeing FB posts of some machaxx people in insti which\n                    made me criticize myself again and not save the world dying\n                    of corona! My journal from then would read something like,\n                    \"why am I thinking about this stupid problem, why don't I\n                    feel like saving the world, why can't I be like Obama, why\n                    is this thing bothering me\". <br /> <br />\n                    Oh boy, I was a hard mother for myself! I was trying to push\n                    myself too much to get out of the cycle and be on my old\n                    routine of working my ass off! This did result in some good\n                    as my pushy nature ensured that I was properly apping to\n                    different unvis and profs. I also contacted some seniors for\n                    some apping advices, one of which is my closest friend\n                    presently! Apping somewhat helped me get my current\n                    internship at Indiana University as well. I was also able to\n                    contribute to the Roommate Matching project which I would\n                    attribute to my motivating mentor and hardworking co-mentee\n                    from Caltech. Lately, I've been thinking that that maybe it\n                    is good to push ourselves and raise our limits but only to a\n                    point that we don't break ourselves (just like our parents\n                    do). <br /> <br />\n                    I also would mention that I was in contact with a SWC mentor\n                    which I don't want to skip as she really helped me let out\n                    my thoughts weekly and I guess its good to consider if\n                    you're having an emotional period specially with this\n                    lockdown, second wave and emerging third wave! <br /> <br />\n                    Winter breaks are usually small in insti but this years was\n                    smaller coz all of our year's holidays were sucked into\n                    corona holiday's earlier only. We had about a month long\n                    with us.The best thing that happened this winter was FeMeal,\n                    my startup. Originally we started with preparing for the\n                    Hult Prize competition which we won and then we started\n                    pursing this full time. This truly was when I felt good and\n                    confident about myself after 4 months. I did a short 1.5\n                    months long intern at Idfy, Mumbai. This is such a nice\n                    company with such great corporative vibes lol! I got payed\n                    well so that ticked all the boxes. I wasn't super productive\n                    again but as time heals everything, I was better. I wanted\n                    to take things slow because the counter productive game that\n                    goes in my head became quite clear to me! <br /> <br />\n                    I wanted to start reading again which I did -- oh man, when\n                    the little sun rises in the cold winters and you can for\n                    once laze out outside, feeling like an old women and read\n                    your book -- it feels so satisfying:) I read \"And then they\n                    were none\" -- which was a nice 'one-time' read book and the\n                    \"Startup Sutra\" which was again a nice 'one-time' read. I\n                    started working diligently towards Women Who Code and took\n                    lead for organizing various events. I didn't get on a\n                    regular bath schedule again which is fair, given the icy\n                    cold winters North have! <br /> <br />\n                    For the semester 4, I honestly didn't plan a lot as my\n                    planning failed majorly last semester. I however did plan\n                    one thing which was taking 54 credits. Well yes, I saw this\n                    as the only way to do justice to my CPI drop last semester.\n                    For the courses, I didn't even choose the easier ones, coz\n                    you know if I have to do it, I'll do it tough. I knew that\n                    as my academic load would be high and I'd have to work on my\n                    startup, FeMeal along with preparing for Hult Prize\n                    Regionals (to be held in February), I would have less time\n                    to weep! <br /> <br />\n                    January was the most packed month for me, I had my intern\n                    from winters going on as well. I had to work for FeMeal and\n                    had planned two events for WWC that I was leading, all of\n                    this along with my academics to manage, I was super serious\n                    about academics this semester as I had to increase my CPI.\n                    My elder cousin brother came home in around then and oh god\n                    which is when I realized how much I missed human contact! By\n                    February, I guess my soul returned to my body and I was back\n                    chirpy, on the track with the academics and every other\n                    commitment I had to manage. I was sad sometimes but then\n                    maybe because I resonated too much with the meme -- \"Mera\n                    Janam toh Gayal hone ke liye hi hua hai\", I was back normal\n                    pretty quickly. I reconnected with my old school friends and\n                    it was super fun! This was the semester I started working\n                    for MRT devotedly as well, did some coding and helped\n                    onboard freshies in the team smoothly.\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    After midsems, I was more focused on academics (I guess that\n                    happens with everyone lol!) and I gave less time to some\n                    less prioritized commitments. I was \"officially\" selected\n                    for my Indiana intern by that time and even those meetings\n                    began to happen. I applied for Department Research\n                    Coordinator and got selected for the year 21-22. Inter IIT\n                    Tech came again this year in about March and we won Silver\n                    (in a high prep challenge) and were second overall! This\n                    year the tech meet was much more huge and we had an amazing\n                    team, which I absolutely enjoyed working with! Oh and\n                    thankfully, I didn't fall in love this year:) <br /> <br />\n                    The most amazing and important thing that I did this\n                    semester was losing my weight. I didn't had much, but I\n                    gained a couple kgs in this lockdown and I had thyroid.\n                    After some fruitless efforts of some weeks of leaving sugar,\n                    I contacted one of my very close friends (yes, the same\n                    apping tips guy) who himself had lost massive weight who\n                    guided me on my \"weight loss journey\" -- it ain't too much\n                    but honest work. I like a good pupil followed him and now I\n                    feel good about my body:) Finally, the semester ended which\n                    I feel like the longest till now xD with overall nice grades\n                    and yes my CPI is back to normal again:) Oh I didn't mention\n                    I guess, but I did came in touch with all my insti friends\n                    again:)\n                    <br /> <br />\n                    So yes, this was a brief peek in my 2 years journey at IIT\n                    Bombay, full of ups and downs. I would say that I hustle too\n                    much and hence sometime end up getting in trouble which I'm\n                    completely okay with. I like to try different projects and\n                    things that interests me to do more. <br /> <br />\n                    Finally, as legends do, some advice that I would give my\n                    freshie self would be -- don't doubt yourself, you're just\n                    as good as others and you're a strong hardworking person who\n                    knows how to work for things that actually matter -- so you\n                    will sail through, oh and yes, don't fill in the form for\n                    Inter IIT Tech, just don't xD!\n                  </p>\n                {/* </blockquote> */}\n              </Card.Body>\n            </Card>\n          </Col>\n          <Col\n            md={5}\n            style={{ paddingTop: \"120px\", paddingBottom: \"50px\" }}\n            className=\"about-img\"\n          >\n            {/* <img src={laptopImg} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" /> */}\n            {/* <img src={selfImg1} alt=\"about\" className=\"img-fluid\" /> */}\n          </Col>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default TwoYearsAtIITB;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
